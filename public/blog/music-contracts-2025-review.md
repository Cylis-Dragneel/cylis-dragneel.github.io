**Fav Track:** _Here - JUNNA_
**Least Fav Track:** _Elusional - Jules Conroy_

- **Elusional (3/5)**
- _"Is a good song, I don't dislike it. I am you could say neutral, like I'd be fine listening to it every once in a while but not one I'd go out of my way to listen to."_
- **Hero (4/5)**
- _"I didn't like this at the start, but that might have something to do with my mood at that time. After listening to it a few more times, I am big fan (pun intended). Definitely checking out their discog after this."_
- **Amen, I'm Going Somewhere (5/5)**
- _"Can Kensuke Ushio miss? No. Just straight vibes, definitely in my top 5 of this playlist. The blend of instruments, the vocals. Love everything about it."_
- **Seeking Stars (4/5)**
- _"I love Mori's songs, don't think I dislike a single one. This one definitely has some recency bias as well as the persona vibes adding to the score. Still, love it. Which persona fan doesn't like Lotus Juice? Goated collab."_
- **Paulownia Mall (4/5)**
- _"Just repeating myself, but a persona song is basically cheating. Not my favorite P3 reload OST but nonetheless a vibe."_
- **Good Nightmare (5/5)**
- _"Touhou?!? Yes please, this would've been my favorite song if it werent't for `Here`. Just scratches all of the itches, ticks almost all of my checkboxes for what I like in music."_
- **Just Wanna xxxx With You (8/10)**
- _"I love Ado, and I discovered Phantom Siita earlier this year and I have been in love since. Before listening to any of the other music I for sure thought this was the one that would be my favorite. Unexpectedly I was instead met with"_
- **Be My Guest (5/5)**
- _"An Azari song I hadn't heard before but instantly became my favorite Azari song. I love vocaloid and wasn't expecting to actually see any vocaloid songs in my playlist so it's a welcome surprise."_
- **.... by x0o0x (5/5)**
- _"This is a song I recognize, I remember seeing it on my youtube homepage last year and it instantly caught my attention cause it didn't have a title and you know what if it weren't for that I would have never heard it and never discovered this great song, well until this playlist I guess ðŸ˜…. And speaking of vocaloid, another great vocaloid song."_
- **Here (5/5)**
- _"This song... just peak, I don't even have the words to describe it. Heavenly voice. And I don't know something about the desert vibes just really pleases my ears. Also I did not know this was the opening for Ancient Magus' Bride, I had been putting off that show for so long but this song alone makes me want to start it right this moment. So, I know what I am watching once I am done with my contracts."_
- **Reminiscence Reincarnation (5/5)**
- _"A MYTH & ROID song that I haven't heard was a surprise, so I binged their entire discog in the time it took me to write this review. I definitely have a soft spot for songs like this, just chill melodic masterpieces."_
- **Tsumi to Mitsu (5/5)**
- _"Syudo and Mori on one track, that combination is too good. I have been looping this song so much that it's not even funny. A certified bop, I don't even think this song can feel old no matter how many times I listen to it"_
- **Unison (3/5)**
- _"I love Marine, but her songs can be a bit of a hit or miss for me. This is a bit of a miss, again I don't dislike it. ~I genuinely can't name songs that I dislike~ Nvm I remembered first Demon Slayer Opening and Tokyo Ghoul opening, basically I can't dislike an opening unless it becomes a meme or is so overused that it gets tiring. So pretty neutral on this one."_
- **BITE! (4/5)**
- _"Can Hoyo miss with their songs? I swear ZZZ and HSR have had the best OSTs, this is another example of peak. Really fits in with the vibe of the entire playlist to."_
- **Gwen, the Hallowed Seamstress (3/5)**
- _"Can't approve cause I got flashbacks of my League days ðŸ˜‚. Otherwise it's a very good OST for a very cool character (I say as she released after I quit League)."_

**Overall Thoughts:** Really loved the playlist, there were basically zero duds. And I have already looped the playlist a good 10+ times in the time it took me to get the strength to write this review (I was sick). I don't know if it was intentional, but really liked the fact that the songs basically got better and better as you went through the playlist. I liked it enough that I went through the trouble of converting the playlist over to spotify so I could listen to it with even more ease. And big props to making me discover two new artists that I really like, hard to do as I have listened to almost 1600 artists that I really like.

**Final Score: Total Points (68/80)**
