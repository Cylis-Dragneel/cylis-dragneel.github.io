I have had this anime for well a few years at least now. What originally introduced me to this anime all that time ago was [this](https://youtu.be/FgQR2O8PGf4?si=BNVH0fvKHDQX1ftq) fire (pun intended) opening.
To be honest, I was expecting just an action shounen style anime. But what I instead got was so much more.

## The Negatives

Let's just get this out of the way first, the things I didn't like:

1. Dororo's voice. I have an annoyance with certain high-pitched voices, I can't tolerate them and that leads to a headache. And unfortunately Dororo's voice falls in that character so I am not ashamed to say it that I watched this anime on a lower than normal volume to make it bearable.
2. It might be because I watched it on a lower volume (most likely the cause) but the OST other than the OP didn't really stand out to me.

## Positives

I love the entire idea, of how we follow Hyakkimaru's journey to regain his senses and limbs. He starts regaining what once originally belonged to him, but he lost due to the greed of his father, in an RPG-like fashion where the more he kills he levels up you could say.
It's really fun and an interesting perspective of how he deals with suddenly regaining the sense of touch, hearing, and scent. The feelings of pain and rage. Particularly Episode 6 really highlights this.
For me, my favorite episode was Episode 7, where the spider demon falls in love with a human. And you can see through Hyakkimaru's perspective that the color of her soul changes from red to white, signifying her humanization.
