# Welcome!

This blog has been rebuilt from the ground up using modern web technologies:

- **Astro** - Static site generator that ships zero JavaScript by default
- **Tailwind CSS v4** - Utility-first CSS framework  
- **MDX** - Markdown with JSX components for rich content
- **Bun** - Fast JavaScript runtime and package manager

## Why the Change?

The old site was built with vanilla JavaScript and Vite. While it worked, I wanted more control over how blog posts are rendered, especially for images and custom components.

With MDX, I can now:

```tsx
// Use custom components in markdown
<Image src="screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot" size="medium" />

// Add callouts and notes
<Callout type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
  This is a helpful tip!
</Callout>
```

## What's Next?

I'll be migrating all my existing blog posts to this new format. The anime reviews will look much better with proper image galleries and spoiler tags!

Stay tuned for more content.
